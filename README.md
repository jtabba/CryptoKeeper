# Features

## Prices and Values
Crypto Keeper uses a CryptoCompare API to display the prices and numerous values of cryptocurrencies. Changes in price over the course of an hour and a day are also tracked and highlighted in either green or red to indicate whether the movement was positive or negative. To supplement this, the change in % of a price over the course of a day is also displayed to provide an additional layer of information about the asset.

## Graphs
To provide a visual representation of the price fluctuations of all the top 100 cryptocurrencies, Crypto Keeper utilises and displays a line graph to plot the previous 3 month price movements of an asset. The graph is created using the Graph.js and Moment.js libraries, and is coded to render based upon the time and price of an asset at a certain time.

Additional information regarding more specific attributes of a crypto are also displayed on the left-hand side of the graph, hence providing a deeper insight into the distinct details and features of the token.

## Security

Crypto Keeper utilises BCrypt to fully encrypt and salt user passwords in its database. Plaintext passwords are not stored in any way, shape, or form to improve security in the event of a data breach.

Steps have also been taken to mitigate the possibility of an SQL injection.
